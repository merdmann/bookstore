#introduction
This is a training example as follows:

#Scope
A regular customer has requested a provisional version for one of his latest projects: a bookstore.
At the moment it does not need to be an actual store but later on it will be.
We just need to show the books on screen, preferably with a search bar.
These are the requested requirements:

#Functionality
- The technologies used will be: HTML, CSS, JavaScript (no jQuery).
- Customer wants to have this functionality - FancyBox-like (we can't use it because it's jQuery), but we can build simple modal (popup window) and just browse the covers.
- The project must be finished tomorrow because on Wednesday he will ask me to show it to him.
- The books data are hosted on a remote JSON. You must access without downloading it since the client can modify the content without modifying the structure and the project should work without touching anything on the web page.
- Must include a search engine to search for any field in the book. Whether it be title, description or any other.
- The logo (look for one in the web) should be on the top left and the search field on the top right.
- When doing HOVER on each of the covers, it must be rotated to show the title, the description and a "More Info" button (This effect is just CSS. Google is your friend). This button will take you to a more detailed image ("detalle" in the json) of the cover (not the same image) that should be shown in a popup/modal and NOT in another website (FancyBox).
- (Optional) Books should be displayed with a little responsive behaviour. No need to fight with media queries, only a little adaptation with Bootstrap or plain flexbox would be enough.
RESOURCES:
- here is the JSON: https://api.myjson.com/bins/udbm5
Keep an eye on the books, look good ...
DON'T FORGET to send the task COMPLETED through Slack (first GitHub push than Netlify -> link please)
I'll be out today, so I can not help you at all. I hope when I get back everything is ready.
He's a great customer and I trust you. Don't disappoint me. GOOD LUCK!
P.D - The customer just sent me a video with a possible solution. You decide if you want to make it look like this.
